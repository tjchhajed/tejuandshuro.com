                  Finally, the much awaited wedding is knocking on the door. The functions would be taking place in Shirdi on the 8th-9th of May and in Siliguri on 14th of May.
                  We would be highly honored by your presence on those auspicious days. The blessings of the elders, the fun with friends and young ones are all that we wish for.
                  Please don't bring any gifts at all. Your generous presence will serve that purpose already. We would be highly obliged if you give us the chance to host you at the wedding venue. Keeping that in mind, we have already organized
                  your stay there. We hope we all would enjoy those days to the fullest.

                We exchanged short glances with a desire to see him again. We did not have to wait very long - to our surprise we met soon in the German language class where our eyes could meet often. That's why we used to
                sit opposite to each other intentionally. Surprisingly, Shuro never used to return any of my smiles back. He seemed to be ignoring me. Then I decided to unfriend him from my Facebook.
                But he got lucky because soon we actually ‘met’ and ‘talked’ for the first time in Chemnitz city fest with other friends. I realised that Shuro was trying hard to take his eyes off me. Well this confirmed
                that he felt for me but he was either too proud or too shy to admit it.

                the city centre, university library, lectures, events etc. Being very careful, I wanted to be unseen. She, on the other hand, was clever enough to see through my actions.
                She was observing it all along. God forbid I was spying on her for love, but never intended to talk too her. I took it for granted that she would be my wife. Only my
                closest friends knew about it. I must acknowledge that there was absolutely no way that I could get the sweetest girl in the universe until I spoke to her at least for once.
                Teju is such a vivacious person besides being equally gorgeous and intelligent that I couldn't refrain myself from proposing to her.
